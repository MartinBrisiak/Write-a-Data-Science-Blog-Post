# AirBnB Seattle
This is my data analysis of publicly available AirBnB dataset of Seattle.
In provided notebook I'm trying to answer three questions:

    - What are the most popular times in seattle for guests?
    - What's the trend in AirBnB in Seattle?
    - What are the most popular locations?
    
## Installation

To run the notebook download Seattle AirBnB dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/download) and place the `.csv` files into the `./input` directory located at same level as this notebook. Then install required libraries mentioned in `requirements.txt` file.

## Project motivation
To finish first project of udacity nanodegree `Become a Data Scientist`.

## Results
Findings of my analysis can be found in [here](https://medium.com/@martin.brisiak/crystal-ball-tell-us-the-secrets-of-airbnb-in-seattle-f330524ca7e1).
